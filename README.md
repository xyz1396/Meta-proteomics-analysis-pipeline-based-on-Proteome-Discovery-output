  - The Meta DB and the Public DB can both perform well in soil
    proteomics üòä

  - Meta proteomics analysis pipeline based on Proteome Discovery output
    üí°

  - Protein Sequence Databases Generated from Metagenomes and the Public
    Database Reveal Similar Microbial Taxonomic and Functional Changes
    in Soil Metaproteomics. XIONG Y, ZHENG L, MENG XX, SHEN RF, LAN P.
